Yo. I'm Samuel Heinrich L. Soliven. Graduate of BS Chemistry with Materials Science and Engineering. Today, I'm going to discuss periodic trends. There is a reason why elements are arranged as such in the Periodic Table. Properties of elements are more often that not the same in the same family of the table. However, depending on which direction one goes, certain properties change significantly. Some of these properties are electron affinity, atomic size and ionization energies.
